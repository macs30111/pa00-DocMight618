## Introduction 

Hello, everyone! My name is Ken Wang, and I am an international student from Beijing, China, but I have been living and studying in the United States since I was **15** years old. I am a second year MA student in the joint CIR/MACSS program at the University of Chicago. My research interests are: 
* International Security
* European Security
* Political Communication (especially its intersection with international security)
* International Institutions
My current research focus on European security and what factors affect European states' defense spending behavior. I hope you can connect with me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hwang925/).

##Summary of the learning for this assignment
Learning the formatting in GitHub reminded me of my internship with Ballotpedia where I had to learn their formatting to publish content on their website. I reveiew this [page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for this assignment, and it was very helpful!
